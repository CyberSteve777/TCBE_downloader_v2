# TerrariaCraft-Bedrock downloader

Thanks for Ryorama for developing this addon.
This downloader clones code from https://github.com/Ryorama/TerrariaCraft-Bedrock/releases and makes it in one .mcaddon file.


Instructions:
1) Install Python 3.6+ and add it to PATH.
2) Clone this repo.
3) Install requirements: 
   1) For PC users: you need to run command in cmd "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the same dir as main.py file.
   2) For Android/IOS users: install manually libraries from requirements.txt using manager in your python app (you can skip PyQT5 because it doesn't work on Android/IOS).
4) Download addon:
   1) If you are on PC, you can run both main files, but with mainPC.py you can select downloading path using GUI.
   2) If you use Android/IOS, you should run main_aori.py. Result files will be in the same dir as main_aori.py file.
5) open result .mcaddon file using Minecraft
6) Enjoy your game ;)
